Internal links are links between pages in your website. It should open the page in the SAME tab. For example:
`<a href="about.html">ABOUT</a>`

External links are links to pages outside your website. It should open in a DIFFERENT tab. For example:
`<a href="www.rmit.edu.vn" target="_blank">RMIT University</a>`

**Mailto:**
Link to an email. For example: `<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>`

**Anchor:**
Link to move to a section inside the same page. For example: `<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>`

Links can be customized at all of their states. Using what we call pseudo class. Don't worry, it looks complicated, but just copy & paste really.
