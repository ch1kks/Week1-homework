    <p>
      Star Wars Celebration badges have provided a distinct opportunity to
      present a broad range of Star Wars characters with a unique artistic
      vision, a tradition stretching back to the first Celebration in 1999.
      While the badges are, of course, necessary to enter Star Wars
      Celebration’s doors, they often become prized keepsakes long after the
      excitement of new friends, rare moments, and first reveals have receded
      into memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Star Wars Celebration Japan quickly approaching, StarWars.com can now
      reveal the full set of 17 character art pieces that will be presented on
      the event badges, masterfully illustrated in the ukiyo-e style — a
      tradition of Japanese art that thrived in the 17th to 19th centuries — by
      Japanese artist TAKUMI. These beautifully stylized renderings of
      characters from across the Star Wars galaxy now include nine new additions
      revealed here for the first time: Osha Aniseya, Leia Organa, Rey / Kylo
      Ren, Master Sol / the Stranger, Obi-Wan Kenobi / Anakin Skywalker, Cassian
      Andor, Kai Brightstar / Nubs, and Mon Mothma.
